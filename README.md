~~~

- Attempt these problems without using solutions.js first!
- Pseudo-code how you will approach the problem 
- If you cannot figure out what the prompt is asking, look at the test cases
- If that still doesn't help message me on slack
- If you've spent 30 minutes on a problem, to prevent frustration, 
move on to the next problem. Come back to it later. Research the problem.
- Look at the solution
